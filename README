Call for help
-------------

x2x has a long history. It was born in the times when life was hard, window
managers were simple and displays were rectangle. Several implicit assumptions
survived during the x2x lifetime, and now need reconsideration. As x2x is simple
(however, it has accumulated inner knowledge of X11 implementations), we are
looking for brave person who can read and understand whole x2x and will write
new x2x, adapted to the modern life of dynamically attached and detached
displays, complex data transferring through the X selections and Xinerama.

Authors
-------

x2x was initially developed in DEC by David Chaiken.
Current maintainer is Mikhail Gusarov.
